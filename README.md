IPA
===
This contains YAML data for representing the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in HTML.

I just wanted to play around with IPA and thought I might as well share the data. You can view an HTML example of the data on [my website][] where Iâ€™ve just looped through the YAML data and put it in a table with [Liquid][] in [Jekyll][].
